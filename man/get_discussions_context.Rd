\description{
A group of functions which deal with \href{https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/discussion_topics.html}{discussion topics}.
\itemize{
\item \code{get_discussions_context}: get all discussions belonging to a course or group. Note that theoretically this should include announcements, as they are technically discussions, but does not. Use \code{get_announcements} instead.
}

get_discussion_id(4371405, 1350207)
